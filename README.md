# team-profile-generator
## Making a team profile generator using OOP
This project is a Javascript based application that builds an HTML file using user input. This project was good for me by giving me good practice with building classes to create a project.

## My takeaway from this project
What I learned from trying to fully complete this project, was that my current strength does not lie in Object oriented programing. This is a topic that I will have to revisit when bootcamp ends. My study group helped me a lot but however I was not able to fully complete the acceptance criteria at this time.

## Link to video of user input
Here is a screen recorded video I recorded using ScreenCastify.
